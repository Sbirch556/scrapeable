Financial Modeling Prep fetches their data directly from SEC.gov and is consistently updated as noted [here](https://github.com/antoinevulcain/Financial-Modeling-Prep-API/issues/6). Highly recommend you check them out and support them however you can, in my experience amazing API's to fundamental data like this don't stay free for long, just look at https://intrinio.com/, yahoo finance fundamentals, and google finance fundamentals...both of which appear to be making a return in late 2019
